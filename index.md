Hello! I’m **Pooja Manwani**, a doctoral researcher in the **Interdisciplinary Programme in Climate Studies at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay**.

My work explores how **atmospheric aerosols** influence air quality, health, and climate in India. I use a blend of **field measurements**, **chemical analysis**, and **statistical modeling** to trace pollution sources and their impacts — connecting science with real-world solutions.

Before joining IIT Bombay, I completed my **M.Sc. in Atmosphere and Ocean Sciences** from **IIT Bhubaneswar**, graduating *first in class* with a *Best Thesis Award*. My academic path blends atmospheric chemistry, data analytics, and environmental policy thinking.

### ✳️ Research Focus
- Chemical composition and source apportionment of PM2.5  
- Atmospheric chemistry and climate linkages  
- Socio-economic and health implications of air pollution  
- Statistical modeling and data visualization  
- Machine learning applications in environmental science

### 🌿 What Drives Me
I see science as both a lens and a bridge — a way to understand the invisible connections between air, life, and society. My motivation lies in making research accessible, actionable, and artful.

### 🌼 Outside Research
When I’m not analyzing data, I’m usually painting, practicing **aerial yoga**, or curating favorite lines of poetry. Creativity helps me breathe between equations.
